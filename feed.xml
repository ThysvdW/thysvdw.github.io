In 2022, I took on the challenge of recreating all the dashboards from the popular book “The Big Book of Dashboards”.  Through this process, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of Deneb, and I want to share this knowledge with others.

To make this possible, I’m offering the templates for download at a minimal fee on my buymeacoffee  site. These templates include data sets, DAX formulas and Den...

I was recently asked to create a sample report for failed data transfers, with the request being really specific. It needs to be a calendar, that will show red for failures and green for the successes. As I already had a template for the calendar, it was actually pretty straightforward with Deneb.

You can create your own dataset for this, using the following DAX quer...

I recently came across a tweet by @Haquafresh  that pointed to a Tadpole chart that is now available in Tableau. With a 100 lines of json code, excluding configuration, it is also available in PowerBI using Deneb.







&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dataset
The dataset is the Tableau Superstore dataset, that can be found at the following link.

I am a regular visitor to Shad Frigui’s Github  page. He did a post  a while back about alcohol consumption, in which he utilized a “point” mark with a SVG path for the bottle.
We all love our icons and adding it to PowerBI just got a lot easier, with the help of Deneb Custom Visual and Font Awesome’s SVG path for their icons.

The chart was posted as part of the PowerBI Workout Wednesday 2022  challenge.

The dataset can be found on the Workout Wednesday link above.



  Before you continue with the template, please be mindful that I don’t have any music background. The challenge was merely done to see what is possible with Deneb and text layers.
