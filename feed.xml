I was recently asked to create a sample report for failed data transfers, with the request being really specific. It needs to be a calendar, that will show red for failures and green for the successes. As I already had a template for the calendar, it was actually pretty straightforward with Deneb.

I recently came across a tweet by @Haquafresh  that pointed to a Tadpole chart that is now available in Tableau. With a 100 lines of json code, excluding configuration, it is also available in PowerBI using Deneb.







&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dataset
The dataset is the Tableau Superstore dataset, that can be found at the following link.

I am a regular visitor to Shad Frigui’s Github  page. He did a post  a while back about alcohol consumption, in which he utilized a “point” mark with a SVG path for the bottle.
We all love our icons and adding it to PowerBI just got a lot easier, with the help of Deneb Custom Visual and Font Awesome’s SVG path for their icons.

The chart was posted as part of the PowerBI Workout Wednesday 2022  challenge.







&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dataset
The dataset can be found on the Workout Wednesday link above.



  Before you continue with the template, please be mindful that I don’t have any music background. The challenge was merely done to see what is possible with Deneb and text layers.

While scrolling through my twitter timeline, I came across   Deborah Simmonds’s  redo of a Makeover Monday graph. This seemed like an interesting redo for Deneb &amp;amp; PowerBI, as Shad Frigui recently published a Hex-tile map done in Vega-lite.
